## Grids

Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes [predefined classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basic) for easy layout options, as well as powerful [mixins for generating more semantic layouts](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-less).
